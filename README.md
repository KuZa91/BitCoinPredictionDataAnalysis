# BitCoinPredictionDataAnalysis
This software, will predict bitcoin future value by using a statistical approach over the last n value records. The value predicted will then be analyzed in a way that will define the best n for the analysis.
In particular, once the user choose with how many precedent values n the software will work, n bitcoin values ordered chronologically will be readed from the data file, and the software on each step will simulate the n+1 file, for then comparing that with the n+1 value of the data file and shift to the next one.
On each step so, the software will simulate a future bitcoin value basing only on the n precedent values, resulting in a N-n simulated value where N stand for the total data records of the input data file.
Once the simulation has finished, the software will report a .txt on which both the real and simulated values will be reported, the value of Ki Squared divided by the number of simulation executed, so that the user will have a clue on the best value for n in spite of the fact that the simulated records will be greater the smaller is n, and in the end will report the number of predictions correct in function of the total predictions, the last value reported will just analyze anyway if the method simulated will predict correctly if the value will be ascending or descending on the future value.
The .txt results file may also be plotted by using gnuplot, infact the results for a prediction test is shown in this directory.
